This is a conversational program that can hold simple
conversations with the user. The program should recognize key words and phrases and respond accordingly. For our chatbot, our aim was to create a GUI with which the user will interact, create a database of possible keywords and their associated response, and use key words and word frequency to create appropriate responses to the user's input.
